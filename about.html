            This website is built as a way for people to explore and see the wonderful secrets hidden in Pascal’s triangle.
            people Everyone is familiar with Pascal’s Triangle but very few people are aware of all the mathematical wonders
            it holds. I knew I was in for a mathematical treat when I first discovered that the triangle is much more than 
            just for providing binomial coefficients. After going through most of the common properties, I did not find one 
            singular place where I could collectively read about all the properties or visualize them. So, I took the task upon 
            myself to create such a place, and would be a good opportunity to build a pure Frontend only project. I wanted this 
            place to be for everyone seeking knowledge about Pascal’s Triangle like myself. This website serves the knowledge 
            about Pascal’s triangle and all its known properties which are just increasing day by day. Pascal’s Triangle is nothing
            else than one of the maths ultimate creations.
