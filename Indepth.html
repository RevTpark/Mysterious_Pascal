                <p>
                    To create a pascal's triangle we add the elements as we go down the triangle, So instead we try to add them row-wise. While adding each row, 
                    we notice the pattern of the sums appears to be in powers of 2. <br> Example: 0<sup>th</sup> row sums to 1 => 2<sup>0</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup> 
                    row sums to 2 => 2<sup>1</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row sums to 4 => 2<sup>2</sup>, so on. And we obtain the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...

                    When we add each number individually we obtain 2<sup>n</sup> for the given n<sup>th</sup> row. While one might think joining the numbers in the n<sup>th</sup> row also gives us 11<sup>n</sup>
                    but it appears to be the case for the first 4 rows after that numbers don't seem to match 11<sup>n</sup>. The correct way is when we add the numbers in a unitary decimal fashion, 
                    we start to see the powers of 11, which also holds after the 4<sup>th</sup> row. <br> Example: 2<sup>nd</sup> row gives 100 + 20 + 1 = 121 => 11<sup>2</sup>, 
                    5<sup>th</sup> gives 100000 + 50000 + 100000 + 1000 + 50 + 1 = 1,61,051 => 11<sup>5</sup>.

                    As the name suggests, this property concludes that Pascal Triangle is symmetric over the Y-axis or we can say it has mirror symmetry, ie,
                    When viewed in a mirror the pascal's triangle will remain unaffected and appears the same. This property is more visual but has mathematical proof as well.
                    In simple terms, the proof glances over the fact that <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n-r</sub>.

                    Assume we have been given <strong>n</strong> objects and we need to pick <strong>r</strong> (where r <= n) objects from them. As we know, the number of ways 
                    to do so is <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>. We can use pascal's triangle to check this instantaneously by going to the n<sup>th</sup> row and checking the 
                    r<sup>th</sup> element. The vice versa also holds true, wherein it is impossible to draw an infinite Pascal's triangle, so <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> can be used 
                    to find the value of any element in the triangle. <br> Example: To find <sup>5</sup>C<sub>2</sub> we can go to the 5<sup>th</sup> row and check the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    element and we get 10, so we can conclude <sup>5</sup>C<sub>2</sub> = 10.

                    Even though it might not look like there could be a relation between the prime numbers in the triangle but Prime Number verification can be done using Pascal's Triangle.
                    Assume we have a number <strong>n</strong> and we want to verify if it is Prime or not. We can go to the n<sup>th</sup> row of Pascal's triangle and check if 
                    <strong>n</strong> is divisible by all the non-one elements(elements with value not equal to 1). If it is the number is Prime Number, otherwise, it is not a Prime Number.
                    The vice versa also holds true, i.e., when the 1<sup>st</sup> element of a row is prime then all other elements are divisible by that number.
                    <br>Example: n = 5, Now 5<sup>th</sup> row has elements 5,10,10,5. Since all elements are divisible by 5 we can verify that 5 is Prime.

                    Even the Fibonacci Sequence makes an appearance in Pascal's Triangle. There seems no obvious pattern that leads to the Fibonacci Sequence, so how do we obtain it? If we consider the 45-degree 
                    diagonals and draw lines on the triangle, we start to notice the 1<sup>n</sup> diagonal starting from the top that contains a triangle element is [1], the 2<sup>nd</sup> diagonal contains [1], 
                    3<sup>rd</sup> contains [1,1], 4<sup>th</sup> contains [1,2], 5<sup>th</sup> contains [1,3,1] and so on. We still don't see the Fibonacci Sequence just yet. Now we add all elements in each diagonal,
                    We obtain 1, 1, 1+1 = 2, 1+2 = 3, 1+3+1 = 5 <br> => 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ... is the required Fibonacci Sequence.

                    When we color all the odd terms in Pascal's Triangle, we obtain a fractal which is commonly known as Sierpinski’s Triangle. In Sierpinski’s Triangle, We start with an equilateral triangle and 
                    connect the midpoints of the segments to construct another triangle inside. This gives us access to 4 new triangles inside of the main triangle. On those triangles, we can repeatedly perform the 
                    earlier action to get new triangles within the previous triangles. This property is more easily understood visually.

                    Observing the first 9 rows as an example we get 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, and 257. Here starting from 3 we can notice a pattern: 3 (Prime), 5 (Prime), 15 (5*3), 17 (Prime), 51 (17*3), 85 (17*5), 
                    255 (17*15), 257 (Prime). Every number is Prime or multiplication of previous numbers. All the Prime numbers obtained are known as Fermat Primes, that is, they are of the type:
